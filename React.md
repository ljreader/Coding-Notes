## Instructions

* If you haven't already, generate a starter React app using Create React App. You can do this by running `create-react-app reactpractice`. We will run all of the activity code today inside of this boilerplate, as to avoid constantly reinstalling the same node modules.

* Once you have a `reactpractice` React app generated, delete the `src` folder inside of your starter app and replace it with the [src](Unsolved/src) provided with this activity.

* Start the app by running `yarn start` in your terminal, take a moment to study the HTML code being rendered in the browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).


*  yarn start
    Starts the development server.

*  yarn build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

*  yarn test
    Starts the test runner.

*  yarn eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

*  cd reactsandbox
*  yarn start

### Part 1

* Begin installing both the Create React App and Yarn packages globally by running the following command in your terminal:

`npm install -g create-react-app yarn`

npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-app

cd my-app
npm start
